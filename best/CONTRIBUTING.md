This project uses [DeviceScript](https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/)
which provides a TypeScript experience for micro-controllers. 

The best development experience is done through Visual Studio Cocde and the DeviceScript extension;
but a command line tool is also available.

Container development (Codespaces, CodeSandbox, ...)
is supported but connection to hardware (through Serial or USB) is not available.
Simulators and compilers will work.
